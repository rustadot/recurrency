# Prerequisites

1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\*
1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

-   For Mac users, [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/) engine also installs docker compose environment, so no need to install it separately.

## Hardware

We run benchmarks with and recommend the same [reference hardware specified by Parity](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware).

# Build

## Local Desktop

1. Install Rust using the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Check out this repository
3. `rust-toolchain.toml` specifies the standard toolchain to use. If you have `rustup` installed, it will automatically install the correct toolchain when you run any cargo command.
4. Running `make check` will run cargo checks for all frequency features. This is the recommended way to check your code before committing. Alternatively, you can run following for specific features:

    ```sh
    make check-local
    make check-rococo
    make check-mainnet
    ```

5. Build Wasm and native code.

    _Note, if you get errors complaining about missing
    dependencies (protobuf, cmake, yarn, node, jq, etc.) install them with your favorite package
    manager(e.g. Homebrew on Mac) and re-run the command again._

    ```sh
    rustup update
    cargo clean
    make build
    ```

    Above will build frequency with all frequency features. Alternatively you may run following command to build with specific features:

    ```sh
    make build-local
    make build-rococo
    make build-mainnet
    ```

    To build local, rococo or mainnet features respectively.

At this point you should have `./target/release` directory generated locally with compiled
project files.

### asdf Support

Install the required plugins for asdf:

```sh
asdf plugin-add rust
asdf plugin-add make
asdf plugin-add cmake https://github.com/srivathsanmurali/asdf-cmake.git
asdf plugin-add protoc https://github.com/paxosglobal/asdf-protoc.git
```

Install the dependency versions declared in `.tool-versions`

```sh
asdf install
```

NOTE: I could find no clang plugin that worked so your system still needs clang to be installed.

## Remote Instance such as AWS EC2

For remote instances running Linux, if you want to check out and build such as on an AWS EC2 instance, the process is slightly different to what is in the [Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/linux/).

### Ubuntu

1. Upgrade the instance and install missing packages with `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt upgrade git
sudo apt install â€”-assume-yes build-essential
sudo apt install --assume-yes clang curl libssl-dev cmake
```

2. Follow [official instructions to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), but select `3. customize the installation`, then reply **n** to `Modify PATH variable? (Y/n)`
3. Follow steps 6-10 at [Substrate: Linux development](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/install/linux/)
4. Proceed with checking out and building frequency as above.

# Run

There are 2 options to run the chain locally:

_Note, Running frequency via following options does not require binary to be built or chain specs to be generated separately, and is programmed within the scripts for simplicity._

1.  Collator Node in Instant/Manual Sealing Mode,
2.  Collator Node with Local Relay Chain

## 1. Collator Node in Instant/Manual Sealing Mode

![](docs/images/local-dev-env-option-1.jpg)

This option runs just one collator node without the need for a relay chain.

Blocks can be triggered by calling the `engine_createBlock` RPC

```sh
curl http://localhost:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d   '{ \
    "jsonrpc":"2.0", \
    "id":1, \
    "method":"engine_createBlock", \
    "params": [true, true] \
    }'
```

### Terminal: Instant Sealing

Same as Manual Sealing, but will also automatically trigger the formation of a block whenever a transaction is added to the validated transaction pool.
Great for most testing.

```sh
make start
```

Also available as a Docker image: [`frequencychain/instant-seal-node`](https://hub.docker.com/r/frequencychain/instant-seal-node)

```sh
docker run --rm -p 9944:9944 -p 9933:9933 -p 30333:30333 frequencychain/instant-seal-node
```

To stop running chain hit [Ctrl+C] in terminal where the chain was started.

| **Node**                |             **Ports**             | **Explorer URL**                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | :-------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency Collator Node | ws:`9944`, rpc`:9933`, p2p:`3033` | [127.0.0.1:9944](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer) |

### Terminal: Manual Sealing

Will only form a block when the `engine_createBlock` RPC is called.
Great for testing multiple items in the same block or other block formation tests.

```sh
make start-manual
```

## 2. Collator Node with Local Relay Chain

![](docs/images/local-dev-env-option-2.jpg)

### Mixed Terminal/Docker

This option runs one collator node as local host process and two relay chain validator nodes in each own docker container.

1. Start relay chain validator nodes.

    ```sh
    make start-relay
    ```

1. Register a new parachain slot (parachain id) for Frequency. _Note, if parachain was
   previously registered on a running relay chain and no new registration is required,
   then you can skip the above step._
    ```sh
    make register
    ```
1. Generate chain spec files. If this is your first time running the project or
   new pallets/runtime code changes have been made to Frequency, then the chain specs
   need to be generated. Refer to [generation spec file](#generate-a-new-spec-file)
   for more details.

1. Start Frequency as parachain. This step will generate genesis/wasm and onboard the
   parachain.

    ```sh
    make start-frequency
    ```

1. Onboard Frequency to the relay chain
    ```sh
    make onboard
    ```

#### Stop and Clean Environment

1. Off-board Frequency from relay chain.: `make offboard`
2. to stop Frequency running in the terminal: `[Ctrl+C] `
3. Stop the relay chain. `make stop-relay`
4. Run to remove unused volumes. `make docker-prune`
5. Clean up temporary directory to avoid any conflicts with next onboarding:
   `rm -fr /tmp/frequency`

### All in Docker Container

:exclamation: Currently does not work on M\* series MacOS laptops. See https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/frequency/issues/432

Start:

```sh
make start-frequency-docker
```

Stop:

```sh
make stop-frequency-docker
```

| **Node**             | **Ports**                           | **Explorer URL**                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frequency Relay Node | ws:`9944`, rpc`:9933`, p2p:`30333`  | [127.0.0.1:9944](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer) |
| Alice Relay Node     | ws:`:9946`, rpc`:9935`, p2p:`30335` | [127.0.0.1:9946](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9946#/explorer) |
| Bob Relay Node       | ws:`:9947`, rpc`:9936`, p2p:`30336` | [127.0.0.1:9947](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9947#/explorer) |

## Run Tests

```sh
# Run all the tests
make test
# Activate selected features
cargo test --features frequency
```

### Integration Tests

To run the integration tests, run `make integration-test`.

## Run Benchmarks

```sh
make benchmarks
```

# Format, Lint and Audit Source Code

-   Format code with `make format` according to style guidelines and configurations in `rustfmt.toml`.
-   Lint code with `make lint` to catch common mistakes and improve your [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code.
-   Alternatively, run `make format-lint` to run both at the same time.
-   Run `cargo-deny` to audit Cargo.lock files for crates with security vulnerabilities reported to the RustSec Advisory Database. [See cargo-deny installation instructions](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny)

# Verify Runtime

1. Check out the commit at which the runtime was built.
2. Use srtool to verify the runtime:
    ```sh
    TARGET=build-runtime RUST_TOOLCHAIN=nightly ./tools/scripts/build.sh
    ```

# Local Runtime Upgrade

To upgrade the runtime, run the following command:

```sh
make upgrade-local
```

The current scripts follow this process for upgrading locally:

1. Build new runtime and generate the compressed wasm: `make specs-rococo-2000`
2. Call `authorizeUpgrade` extrinsic from parachain system to initiate the upgrade.
3. Call `enactAuthorizedUpgrade` extrinsic from parachain system to enact the upgrade.
4. For testnet and mainnet, the upgrade is done slightly differently using `scheduler` and enactment is scheduled for a specific block number in the future.
