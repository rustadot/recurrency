# HOW TO: Add a New Collective
### when democracy/collectives are already present

There will be three structs generated by this process, say for a collective called "GreatCouncil", you will have:
* **GreatCouncil** = this is what it's called in `construct_runtime!`
* **GreatCouncilInstance** = `pallet_collective::InstanceN`
* **GreatCouncilConfig** = the config that is automatically generated, which must be defined in the chain specs.

1. **Edit all runtime configs**, in our case, `frequency/src/lib.rs` and `frequency-rococo/src/lib.rs`:
    1. Create a new instance where “N” is the next incremental instance number:
       ```GreatCouncilInstance = pallet_collective::InstanceN```
    2. Set up the configuration for the instance similarly to the other collectives.
    3. Add the new instance to `construct_runtime!`
2. **Edit all chain spec files** - in our case `frequency.rs`, `frequency_rococo.rs`, and `frequency_local.rs`:
    1. **Import the Config**: add `GreatCouncilConfig` to the `use frequency_runtime::{}` import line at the top of the file.
    2. **Update the genesis functions**: Add a parameter (e.g. `great_council_members`) for the collective to each genesis function:
        * `frequency_genesis`
        * `frequency_rococo_genesis`
        * `testnet_genesis`
    3. **Pass and use the values for the new parameters**: Add values for the new parameter to all the functions that call the genesis files:
        * `development_config`
        * `local_testnet_config`,
        * `frequency`
        * `frequency_rococo_testnet`
3. **Update js/api-augment** to ensure that the RPCs are added to the js library.
    1. Update ./definitions
    2. Build and start the chain (does not need to be on-boarded)
    3. Run npm run fetch:local
    4. Run npm run build

### You should have changes to:
* All files in `node/service/src/chain_spec/<runtime>.rs`
* all `<runtime>/src/lib.rs` files
* The `js/api-augment` directory for the new collective RPC endpoints
