## Context and Scope
In order to properly implement Frequency, we need to describe how service providers
will participate on the network.

## Problem Statement
Service providers are an integral part of how Frequency functions. However, there are
some open questions about how they operate, questions that this document hopes
to provide clarity on.

Among those questions are:

1. Who can become a provider?
1. How does a user become a provider?
1. What are the attributes of a provider?
1. How will providers be identified to other network actors?
1. How does one stop being a provider?
1. Can provider status be revoked from a provider?

## Goals and Non-Goals
This document will discuss the ways in which service providers can register with
and participate in the Frequency network.

This document will not discuss the specifics of how providers will process
service requests from users on the network. This document will also not discuss
specifics around creating and honoring transactions between users.

## Proposal
The basic workflow for provider registration is as follows:
1. Any user can register to be a Provider.
1. User pays the balance to become a provider. This is called a "Registration Fee".
1. The "Registration Fee" is set by Governance.
1. The "Registration Fee" is credited to the Chain Treasury (TBD).
1. The provider's MSA id is added to storage on chain.

Please note:
* All names are placeholders and may be changed.
* Types may change as needed during implementation phase
* Errors in the extrinsic(s) must have different, reasonably-named error enums
  for each type of error for ease of debugging.

### Types
* `ProviderMetadata`
  * `name`: `Vec<u8>`

#### Events
* `ProviderRegistrationEvent<T: Config>`, the resource that exists on-chain
  * `block_number`: `BlockNumber`
  * `provider_msa_id`: `MsaId`

#### Storage
* `ProviderRegistry<T: Config>`: `StorageMap<MsaId, ProviderMetadata>`
  * Stores registered providers and provides lookup functionality via `MsaId`.
    Existence in this storage structure implies that a provider's fee has been
    paid and their registration was otherwise successful.

### Extrinsics
#### register_provider(origin, provider_name)
Creates and posts a `ProviderRegistrationEvent`. The `MsaId`
included in the registration must already exist.

This extrinsic is responsible for storing the registered provider in the
`ProviderRegistry`.

* **Parameters**
  * `origin`: `Origin`  required for all extrinsics, the caller/sender.
  * `provider_name`: the name used for the provider.
* **Event**:  `Event::<T>::ProviderRegistrationEvent(provider_msa_id)`
* **Restrictions**:
  * `origin`'s `msa_id` must have capacity to post the transaction (including fee) during the current epoch.


### Custom RPCs
#### get_provider(provider_msa_id)
Retrieves a single provider. The `provider_msa_id` should belong to a registered
provider.

* **Parameters**
  * `provider_msa_id`: `MsaId` the `MsaId` of the provider in question.

* **Returns**
  * `None()` if no messages meet the criteria.
  * `Some(Provider)`

## Benefits and Risks
### Provider Registry and Info
This structure allows for easy provider lookups, in the event actors on the
chain need to query provider information. As of the time of writing this
document, the only provider information required is a name (non-unique). In the
future, we may include other information like domain, logo, business address, etc.

### Provider Verification
There should be a way to verify whether providers are legitimate entities. As of
now, there is no authority that we can query to verify providers, nor is there a
real-world counterpart that can verify provider information.

In the future, we may require a business domain (w/ SSL certificate) to grant
provider status. However, doing so would bar entities that do not have
traditional business attributes from participating on the network as service
providers ("mom and pop" local businesses and/or "freelancers").

So to allow inclusion for all actors, it may be that the best way of verifying
legitimateness is through a fee that is high enough to discourage malicious actors.

### Provider Commitment
Users can only delegate to Providers. Only Providers can have Capacity and can therefore generate capacity transactions.
### Archival Provider Information
If consumers want to examine provider registration events, they
must fetch them from an archival node. This document does not outline an RPC for
fetching registration events.

## Alternatives
### Provider Fees
This document assumes that registration fees will be a fixed amount. It may be prudent, in the future, to determine whether or not registrations are fixed or vary based on the amount of verifiable information given on a registration attempt. The latter may allow us to place more trust in providers that do not have traditional business attributes. Further, the Provider could be required to post a bond instead of or in addition to fee payment.
### Provider Deregistration
Currently, the Provider MSA id cannot be retired once registered. The current version does not entirely outline a way to revoke the Provider's status. In the future, Provider can request to revoke their status as a service provider. Provider MSA id may be deregistered, with their MSA id removed from the Provider Registry and any associated delegations revoked.
